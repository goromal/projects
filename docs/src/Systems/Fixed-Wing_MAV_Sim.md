# Fixed-Wing Micro Air Vehicle Simulation

![](../img/FWSim.png)

This was a ground-up implementation of simulation and autonomy algorithms in Matlab and Simulink, from dynamic modeling to path planning. In total, this was a culminating implementation of every chapter in the book [Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice](https://github.com/byu-magicc/mavsim_public) by Beard and McLain (2012).
