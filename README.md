# Projects

Assorted autonomy-related projects that I've worked on either during my free time or from when I was in school.

To generate updated docs, run

```bash
python scripts/generate_docs.py
```

*Auto-generated as part of CD pipeline.*

Serve the docs locally with

```bash
bash scripts/serve_docs.sh
```
